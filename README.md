# HTor project for infocom2018

### (A demo will be uploaded before 8/13)

### HTor is designed for unlinkable communication online. Most tools online fail to achieve this goal against surveillance. HTor achieve this goal against greastest global adversaries.

### HTor has three features to make communication more than unlinkable:

1. Covertness. All communications over HTor is highly unobservable, ensured by carefully designed covert channels over HTTP. We examined the covertness by large scale experiments.

2. Unlinkability. We proof that HTor can assure K-unlinkability against strong adversaries. For adversaries who can not corrupts the middle server, HTor can add unwitting web page visitors to enlarge its unlinkability set. For example, if one website has 1000 visitors over a day, then the value of K can be 1000 even when there are only one HTor clients in these 1000 clients.

3. Deniability. We prove that HTor clients can deny previous communications easily by keep changing keys and the cover of cooperative HTor server.

### Here we present a list of sample code for:

- [x] a htor server sample code

- [x] a htor client sample code

- [x] a neural network model code

- [x] a htor demo online comprising a server and a browser plugin
